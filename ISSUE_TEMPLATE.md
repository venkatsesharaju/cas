# Thanks

We want to start off by saying thank you for using CAS. This project is a labor of love, and we appreciate all of the users 
that catch bugs, make performance improvements, and help with documentation. Every contribution is meaningful, so thank you 
for participating. That being said, here are a few guidelines that we ask you to follow so we can successfully address your issue.

# Before you report issues

In order to streamline the process of evaluating issues, we ask that you:

- First, check with CAS' user mailing list to see if the issue has been reported there and if there are any workarounds.
- Cross check with the official CAS documentation to see if there are any missing steps in your configuration.
- Check CAS' issue tracker to see if your issue has already been reported.
 
# Remember that...

If you have a question about how to configure a feature in CAS, please use the CAS mailing lists instead. If your submission is not an actual issue or does not carry enough diagnostic data described and enumerated below, the issue may be automatically tagged and closed.

## To reproduce the issue

When and where appropriate, please submit your CAS configuration/overlay to this project in form of a pull request so we could easily evaluate your deployment configuration to reproduce the issue:
