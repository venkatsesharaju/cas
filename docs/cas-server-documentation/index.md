While the project is rooted in higher-ed open source, it has grown to an international audience spanning
Fortune 500 companies and small special-purpose installations.

## Getting Started

We recommend reading the following documentation in order to plan and execute a CAS deployment.

* [Architecture](planning/Architecture.html)

* [Installation Requirements](planning/Installation-Requirements.html)
* [Overlay Installation](installation/Maven-Overlay-Installation.html)

## Demo

The CAS web application is available for demo at [https://jasigcas.herokuapp.com/cas](https://jasigcas.herokuapp.com/cas)

It is important to note that this is a public demo site, used by the project for basic showcases and integration tests. It is **NOT** set up for internal demos and it may go down and up as the project needs without notice. If you have a need for a demo instance with a modified UI, that would be one you set up for your deployment.
