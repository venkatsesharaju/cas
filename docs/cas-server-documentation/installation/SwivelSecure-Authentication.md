# Swivel Secure Authentication

Swivel Secure offers a wide range of authentication factors, allowing the use of 2FA and image based authentication. To learn more, please refer to [the official website](https://swivelsecure.com/).

CAS supports Swivel Secure's TURing-image based authentication. TURing uses the PINsafe protocol to provide a One Time Code for authentication. Each image is unique for that session.
